# Flux Model Zoo

**Note:** These examples are in the process of being upgraded for Julia 1.0. Until then, they work best with Julia v0.6.

This repository contains various demonstrations of the [Flux](http://fluxml.github.io/) machine learning library. Any of these may freely be used as a starting point for your own models.

The models are broadly categorised into the folders [vision](/vision) (e.g. large convnets), [text](/text) (e.g. various RNNs and NLP models), [games](/games) (reinforcement learning). See the READMEs of respective models for more information.
