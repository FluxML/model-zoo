# Flux Model Zoo

This repository contains various demonstrations of the [Flux](http://fluxml.github.io/) machine learning library. Any of these may freely be used as a starting point for your own models.

The models are broadly categorised into the folders [vision](/vision) (e.g. large convolutional neural networks (CNNs)), [text](/text) (e.g. various recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and natural language processing (NLP) models), [games](/contrib/games) (Reinforcement Learning / RL). See the READMEs of respective models for more information.

## Usage

The zoo comes with its own [Julia project](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/#Using-someone-else's-project), which lists the packages you need to run the models. You can run the models by opening Julia in the project folder and running

```julia
using Pkg; Pkg.activate("."); Pkg.instantiate()
```

to install all needed packages. Then you can run the model code with `include("<model-to-run>.jl")` or by running the model script line-by-line.

Models may also be run with NVIDIA GPU support, if you have a CUDA installed. Most models will have this capability by default, pointed at by calls to `gpu` in the model code.

### Gitpod Online IDE

Each model can be used in [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/), just [open the repository by gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo)

* Based on [Gitpod's policies](https://www.gitpod.io/pricing/), free access is limited.
* All of your work will place in the Gitpod's cloud.
* It isn't an officially maintained feature.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of new models and documentation. 

### Share a new model

If you want to share a new model, we suggest you follow these guidelines:

* Models should be in a folder with a project and manifest file to pin all relevant packages.
* Models should include a README(.md) to explain what the model is about, how to run it, and what results it achieves (if applicable).
* Models should ideally be CPU/GPU agnostic and not depend directly on GPU functionality.
* Please keep the code short, clean, and self-explanatory, with as little boilerplate as possible.

### Create or improve documentation

You can contribute in one of the following ways 

* Add or improve documentation to existing models: Write the following information:
  * Give a brief introduction to the modelâ€™s architecture and the goal it archives.
  * Describe the Flux API that the model demonstrates (high-level API, AD, custom operations, custom layers, etc.).
  * Add literature background for the model. More specifically, add articles, blog posts, videos, and any other resource that is helpful to better understand the model.
  * Mention the technique that is being demonstrated. Briefly describe the learning technique being demonstrated (Computer vision, regression, NLP, time series, etc.).
* Write in-depth tutorials for a model: You can further extend the documentation of a model and create a tutorial to explain in more detail the architecture, the training routine, use your own data, and so forth. After you write a tutorial, create a PR with it for the [Tutorials](https://fluxml.ai/tutorials.html) section on the [FluxML](https://fluxml.ai/) website.
