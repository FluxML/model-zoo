# Simple time series models with Flux 
This directory has some scripts that show how to do simple time series modeling tasks
using recursive neural networks.

* AR1_LSTM.jl shows how to do one-step ahead forecasting of a simple AR1 time series model. The neural net forecast is essentially the same as the maximum likelihood forecast, see the figure AR1forecasts.png.
* it is planned to add examples for multivariate time series and perhaps forecasting at
    other horizons.
