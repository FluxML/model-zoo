# Character Level Language Model using RNNs
This is an implementation of RNN based Character Level Language Model. In this model,RNN model(based on LSTMs) is given a chunk of huge text on which it is trained to  model the probability distribution of the next character in the sequence given a sequence of previous characters. This will then allow the model to generate new text one character at a time

To train this Model, Shakespeare.txt was used, however any text can be used to train the model.
