# This model can reach accuracies of upto ~22%(close to what is described in the paper)
# After a lot of debugging and asking around
# The fix was found to be to remove every conv layer.
# Previously, whilst using the conv model, the accuracy was stuck at exactly 0.8 and loss at exactly 3.33253
# Changing the model to be that of a simple dense one seems to bring the accuracy up to what is expected.
# In the research paper, authors were able to achive a general accuracy of 24% in the model which they trained from the ground up
# In doing so they used the whole 30000 image dataset. This model uses 1/3 of that datset and around 500 testing images because of processing constraints
# The accuracy achived after 20 epochs was right at ~12%. Considering that it uses a third of the datset, this is pretty decent.
